# Week 3

In the third week of class, we analyzed and reported on the twin-screw amphibious robot we wanted to design. We began by presenting our Background and Motivation.

Backgroundï¼šNowadays, utilizing automated mechanical equipment to explore dangerous environments that are difficult for humans to reach is a very important issue.

Motivation: We plan to design the robot's wheels as two long, thick screws to ensure safe and efficient operation in complex environments.

We then analyzed the CONSTRAINTS and GOALS we designed this robot for.Regarding constraints we have divided them into four parts which are Cost, time-consumption, technical requirement and applicability.

Finally, we produced Overview of Technical Project Plan for Materials, Methods, and Fabrication, and designed the final validation program for our final design project.
